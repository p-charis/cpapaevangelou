excerpt: 'Amongst the many debates within the sphere of platform governance, one is particularly telling of the political stakes at play: how should journalistic content be treated in relation to content regulation? There is, perhaps, no better case in which this is playing out than the upcoming Digital Services Act proposed by the European Commission. Specifically, on the one hand, news media organisations have been lobbying for a дnon-interference principleе that would prevent platforms from moderating editorial content that has been published by credible news sources, while on the other hand, officials, platforms, and civil society experts have been arguing against such a measure, primarily, due to the risk of creating an exploitable loophole for bad actors. This paper aims to unravel the contentious negotiations behind this debate. This article draws from more than a dozen of in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders. Finally, this paper aspires to help inform the multifaceted conundrum of who governs the contemporary digital public sphere, to further expose the risks of entrusting this task solely to social media platforms and, last, to contribute to a much-needed theorisation and reconsideration of news mediaеs role in platform governance.'

The article discusses the negotiations surrounding the treatment of journalistic content in relation to content regulation in the context of the European Union's Digital Services Act. News media organisations lobbied for a privileged treatment of editorial content from platforms’ content moderation systems during the Digital Services Act's negotiations in the European Parliament, which came to be known as ‘non-interference principle’. Although the principle did not make it to the final version of the Digital Services Act, a provision related to the respect of media pluralism and media freedom by platforms was added. This article draws data from in-depth interviews with stakeholders, as well as from an analysis of legal and communication documents. It aspires to shed light on the political-economic tensions that shaped the final version of Digital Services Act and how the European Union attempted to integrate the asymmetric relationship between news media and platforms in its regulatory agenda.
