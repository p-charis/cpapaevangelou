Hi! I'm Charis Papaevangelou (he/him; [here's how my name's pronounced!](https://www.name-coach.com/charis-papaevangelou). I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Amsterdam, based at the Institute for Information Law, where I'm studying the implications of the novel EU platform regulatory framework for the relationship between news media organisations and platforms. I'm part of [AlgoSoc](https://algosoc.org), a massive interdisciplinary programme funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science seeking to offer a compass to guide the algorithmic society.

Overall, my work is positioned at the nexus of media, political, cultural, and social sciences. I hold a Ph.D. from the Laboratory for Applied Social Sciences of the University of Toulouse, where I studied the political economy of online platform governance with a distinct interest in the European landscape. I also hold an M.A. in New Media & Digital Culture from the University of Utrecht and a B.A. in Media, Communications & Culture from the University of Panteion in Athens.

My work has been featured in various news outlets (in Greek, English and French) and international peer-reviewed journals. I'm also a Research Fellow at the Centre for Media, Tech & Democracy of McGill University and the Institute for Alternative Policies in Athens, Greece.

I'm always happy to discuss work, culture and geek out about video-games :) Feel free to reach out to me at: c.papaevangelou@uva.nl; WhatsApp (+310622811437); Signal (+306979483706).
